# Maze Pathfinding Visualizer

## Overview
This project is a web-based **pathfinding visualizer** that allows users to explore and compare two well-known pathfinding algorithms:
- **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

The application provides a graphical representation of a **maze**, where the algorithms navigate from a given **start** position to an **end** position. The backend logic for the pathfinding is implemented in **C++**, while the frontend and API layer are developed using **Next.js**.

---

## Features
- **Maze Visualization:** Displays a grid-based environment where the pathfinding algorithms operate.
- **Dijkstra vs. BFS Comparison Mode:** Runs both algorithms side by side and highlights the differences.
- **Performance Metrics:** Provides statistics on:
  - Number of **cells visited**
  - **Path length** (shortest path found)
  - **Execution time**
- **Web-based Interface:** Built with **React.js (Next.js)** for seamless user interaction.
- **Backend in C++:** Handles pathfinding logic efficiently.
- **Logging Mechanism:** Stores execution logs for debugging and analysis.

## Project Architecture

### 1. Frontend (Next.js)
The frontend is responsible for user interaction, visualization, and API communication. It sends a request to the backend with the maze grid and algorithm selection.

### 2. Backend API (Next.js with Node.js & Child Process)
The backend API in Next.js acts as a bridge between the frontend and the C++ executable. It:
- Accepts POST requests containing **grid data, start position, end position, and the selected algorithm**.
- Saves the data into a **temporary JSON file**.
- Executes the **C++ program** (`Muze-backend.exe`) using the **Node.js child process**.
- Reads the output from the C++ program and returns it as a JSON response to the frontend.

### 3. Pathfinding Logic (C++ Backend)
The C++ program receives the JSON input file from the API, processes the grid data, and executes the selected algorithm (**Dijkstra or BFS**).

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** & **npm** (for the Next.js frontend & API layer)
- **C++ Compiler** (for backend logic)

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khalidEchchahid/Muze-Dijkstra-BFS-nextjs-c-.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Next.js server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`
